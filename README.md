# Computer Craft Music Maker
A little project for CC:Tweaked.
**!ADVANCED PERIPHERALS IS NEEDED TO SETUP A PLAYER!**

In the Organ folder you find all the files needed to set up a Player and in the Phone folder is everything for a Phone to work.

## Current Features
- Using Basalt as UI Libary to provide better Usibility
- Only needs 1 ComputerCraft:Tweaked PC to function
- It can Create, Edit, and Delete player files.
- You can set it up with a PocketPhone with Wireless Modems

There are still some small Bugs that make it Crash, those will be fixed at some point. I dont know when but at some point they will be fixed.
